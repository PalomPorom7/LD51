# LD51

This was my submission for the Ludum Dare Game Jam 51 from September 30th to October 3rd 2022.  The theme of the jam was "Every 10 Seconds".

I was very busy and could only commit a single afternoon to this project.  It was completed solo, so I did not have any art assets to work with.

The design was inspired by the theme of time, using not only the obvious mechanic of timing but also the setting of a clock and being attacked by time in waves of 10 seconds.
